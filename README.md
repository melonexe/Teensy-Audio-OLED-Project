This project is for my portfolio, it is a v2 of a very basic version I made for a final year project during my time at Huddersfield University.

The original project was done using arduino IDE and normal teensy audio library processing. while it did work it was very clunky and basic. Still got a 2:1 though ;)

The final goal for this project is to have a working prototytpe with a fully functional UI and 4 effects made in faust which can be enabled and disabled as the user wishes through the UI.

the menu system will have a main page where each effect and its mix level and bypass state will be visible as well as individual menu pages to change parameters on each effect.

ultimately I would like to be able to have a PCB made for this so I can have some PCB design experience on my CV.

I'd also like to have some modularity so others can use this code and insert their own faust effects and get parameter changes up and running with ease.


If you would like to suggest features or contribute you are welcome to do so!
